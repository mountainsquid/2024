// pop = take something out of the stack, as in popping out 
// push = adding something to the stack, as in pushing in

// declare the array 
let blackPinkMembers = ["jenny", "jisoo", "rose", "lisa"];

// check what's inside the array 
console.log("Black Pink member lineup: ", blackPinkMembers);

// time for surprise stage solo 
// create new variable and use pop method for blackPinkMmebers array 
let surpriseSolo = blackPinkMembers.pop();

// tell who is the soloist 
console.log(surpriseSolo);

// check what's inside the array 
console.log("Black Pink member lineup: ", blackPinkMembers);

// LIFO, last in, first out. 
// draw a chart so you remember the concept 
// before: (1) (2) (3) (4) people entered the bus 
// the (4) person was the last one to enter the bus
// the (4) person will be kicked out of the bus
// therefore, it's last in, first out 
// just like in the pop() example
// oh god where is my lisa
// fr fr no cap 
// this line: let surpriseSolo = blackPinkMembers.pop();
// kicked out lisa of the line up
// fr fr no cap oh god 
// how can can pop() do this to lisa 
// another way to visualize
