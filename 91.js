// Programming session: 91
// Date: Feb 26 2024
// Session: 30 minutes

// time to learn about classes 
// and fully grasps the concepts but in code too 
// when you create an object from a class (blueprint) it's called an instance 
// remember about Pascal case my son 
// software engineering is about storing data in the memory, then using function to ...
// do something with that data. simple as


class bigButt {  // creating the class called bigButt
    constructor(ass) {  // have to create the class to substaniate the object. also arugment binding
        this.ass = ass
    }

    drill() { 
        console.log("I am drilling something. maybe a butt")
    }
}

let lisaButt = new bigButt("Lisa's ass")

console.log(lisaButt)
lisaButt.drill()
