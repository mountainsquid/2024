// Programming session: 31
// Date: Feb 02 2024
// Session: 30 minutes

console.log("hello")

// time to learn more about the switches 
// you can't go wrong with learning about the switches
// I need to refresh on the syntax a bit 
// okay so it seems I've refreshed on switch case and the layer goes deeper
// first there is the if, else if, else statements
// then it evolved into switch case statements
// then it evolved into ternary operator
// like an evovling pokemon it keeps evolving :) 

let benis = 5; 

switch (benis == 5) {
    case 5: 
    console.log("ben is 5 inches")
    break
    default: 
    console.log("ben size is not confirmed")
}

// here we define the age of the car
// in this case you have a 5 year old car 
let carAge = 5 

// gonna hit it up with the if statement
// reason why is because we want some conditional flow for this shieeet
// if the car is old, I'm going to throw it in the garbage
// if it's a car less than 5 years old then keep driving 

// first line being car is greater or equal to 5? 
// then spite something out 
// but what if the car is not that expression?
// then we hit them with something else with the "else" part 
// okay this is fine but what about the else if ?? I want an example of that 

if (carAge >= 5) {
    console.log("your car is 5 or more years old, it's time to get a new car")
} else {
    console.log("your car is doing great")
}

// learning how to do if, else if, else statement
// seems that once it hits the conditional as true, then the if conditional stops
// it doesn't even consider the else if with this code ... 

let bench = 200

if (bench >= 134) {
    console.log("you're a beast! you're lifting more than 134 lbs")
} else if (bench >= 200) {
    console.log("bro, you can lift more than 200 lbs you're insane")
} else {
    console.log("it's time to train harder, every rep counts")
}

// for the if logical stack
// seems like you want to code something greatest chance of being true
// because once something becomes true, the if conditional stops at that block
// if that makes sense 

let squat = 90

if (squat >= 200) {
    console.log("you're a beast! You're squatting 200 lbs") 
} else if (squat >= 150) { 
    console.log("good work, you're squatting more than 150 lbs")
} else {
    console.log("train harder my friend")
}

// so far I've remember if, else if, else statement
// then switch statement 
// next up, I need to refresh on the while loop 
// if you combine if and while loop it seems powerful 
// keep grinding. 

// that's all the coding for this session, see you in the next sesssion :)
