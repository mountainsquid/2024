Time studied: 30 minutes 

01. class keyword, constructor keyword. First create the class, then the constructor. Don't forget. 
02. var userone = new user() // remember this syntax
03. class user {} 
04. constructor() {}
05. const john = new Person("John", 30); (this line calls the constructor)
06. const john = new Person("John", 30) <-- creating new instance 
07. there's class methods, learn how to use that using dot notation :) 
08. define your method outside of the constructor, don't forget 
09. there is something called method chaining, learning about that 
10. OOP is basically creating a blueprint, then creating instances (copies of it) 1000x times 
11. inheritance = creating a new class from an existing class 
12. but why inheritance? because you can reuse existing code without rewriting it 
13. abstraction helps with security by using private or internal keywords
14. the base object, then there's the child object 
15. polymorphism = 1 task, different way
16. constructor function = a function that creates objects
