01. inheritance, inherit function, over-ride function 
02. passing parameter to parent constructor 
03. there is inheritance in solidity
04. there is multi-level inheritance in solidity 
05. there is also single level inheritance, not hard to grasp 
06. contract b is contract a, contract c is contract b 
07. but why inheritance? because programmers are lazy and don't want to rewrite code
08. the base contract (parent class) is the first class, then it's the child class
09. but remember there is inherited function and you can over ride it
10. there's more, a contract can restrict what the child class accesses using visibility modifer
