Notes:

01. front end (react.js) vs backend (node.js)
02. client = machine that is browsing the web 
03. server = backend that delivers and stores the information to the client 
04. using backend framework and package manager to make backend programming easy 
05. expressjs as backend framework 
06. npm for javascript
07. how to save data? we use a database. server stores the database. we can use mongoDB
08. front end sending data to back end = request 
09. backend server sending data back to the front end = response 
10. API = application programming interace 
11. API is one of the most important part of backend coding (but why?)
12. REST = representational state transfer 
13. POST = create something 
14. GET = get something 
15. DELETE = delete something  
16. As of 2024 people rent cloud servers like from Amazon, Microsoft and Google
