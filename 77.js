// all keys are strings in object literal wtf bro 
// key is the name: 
// value is the "Jenny"
// the key is the string, is that so? 

const blackPink = { 
    name: "Jenny",
    age: 25, 
    position: "singer"  

}

// different methods to changing the value, interesting 
// changes the value of the key value pair 
blackPink["name"] = "Lisa"

// change the age of of key value pair 
blackPink.age = 26

// access object key value using (.) notation 
console.log(blackPink.name)
console.log(blackPink.age)

// what is the use of object literal?
// obviously to have some sort of database that you can store 
// for example a hospital database where you can store patient's info
