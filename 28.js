// Programming session: 28
// Date: Feb 01 2024
// Session: 30 minutes

// I need to master functions 
// because that's the most basic building block
// or rather something cool to keep reusing the code 
// declare the function
// call the function 
// nothing happens until you call the function 
// right, continue where I left off  
// function is a global object? 
// local scope = variable exist only inside the function or the block of code
// globe scope = can use throughout the program 

// okay this code is working okay so far 


// I made the silly mistake of not using the let or var keyword
// I think there was a brain fart of some sort but that's okay
// ChatGPT fixed it for me

function eat() {
    let y = 11;
    console.log("this is the local scope only: ", y)
}

eat()

// this is the global scope
// global scope is where you can use it anywhere in the program
// local scope is where the variable only exist inside the function ... (and perhaps anywhere else)

let y = 10 
console.log('this is y global scope: ', y)

// 15 minutes of learning done
// let's try to think of some cool code and ask Poe for the answers
// then try to learn the code because why not 

// there is something that I forget when it comes to function 
// is declaring the variables in the function
// therefore I need to put in the repetition so it becomes muscle memory to put 
// let, var, const
// don't forget my son 

function bigPenis() { 
    let penis1 = 10
    let penis2 = 11
    let penis3 = 13

    console.log("size of 1st penis: ", penis1)
    console.log("size of 2nd penis: ", penis2)
    console.log("size of 3rd penis: ", penis3)
}

bigPenis()

// bro, so a constructor can construct an object? 
// my mind is blown ...
// the constructor is summoned by using a this keyword. 
// interesting.

// that's all the learning for this 30 minute session
// see you in the next session.
