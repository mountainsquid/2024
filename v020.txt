Time studied: 30 minutes  

Thoughts: I could get very far if I simply "pre-learn" 30 minutes every day for a year.


01. higher order function, takes a function as an argument or returns a function 
02. Many higher order functions for array map() n shieet 
03. ternary operator: () ? : don't forget, as if statement that is easy to write 
04. condition ? expression_if_true : expression_if_false; 
05. array has index, object has keys 
06. primitive datatype = simple data type 
07. reference = bigger data type (array, objects)
08. primitive = goes into a stack 
09. reference = goes into a heap 
10. reference = puts a reference to the stack 
11. for (i = 0; i < 10; i++)
12. scope, what is in between the {}. {this is a scope} 
13. the variable inside a function is a local function that can only be used or existed in that function and not outside of it 
14. when debugging think of what is executing and in what order
