01. benefits of object literal in javascript: named properties, flexibility, no order of dependence
02. arrays faster to get data than object literal 
03. delete keyword in javascript, can delete the property of the object 
04. promise in javascript = promise something that will complete in the future 
05. states of a promise: pending, fulfilled, rejected 
06. but why promise? because it's for async programming 
07. but why promise? cleaner code, error handling, sequential execution
08. promise is only in 3 states. 
09. fulfilled = it has been done 
10. pending = it's waiting? 
11. reject = doesn't work 
12. pre-learning is good because can wrap my head around the concept before writing the code
