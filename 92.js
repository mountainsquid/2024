// javascript single thread language, can process only 1 thing at a time 
// thread of execution, going line by line, top down
// but Javascript can be async by using event loop feels okay mang 
// class, blueprint
// object, born out of class's arse
// call stack, has something to do with functions being run in order, some shit like that 
// what's the point of learning about call stack anyways 
// function expression over function declaration remember that my son
// garbage collection = remove data from memory
// 


class bigButt {  // creating the class called bigButt
    constructor(ass) {  // have to create the class to substaniate the object. also arugment binding
        this.ass = ass
    }

    drill() { 
        console.log("I am drilling something. maybe a butt")
    }
}

let lisaButt = new bigButt("Lisa's ass")

console.log(lisaButt)
