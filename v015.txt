01. functions and objects in javascript, and how they're related 
02. buttons, forms, menus. Users click on them, they do something 
03. products, shopping carts, product filtering etc. users interact, it does something etc. You get the idea. 
04. regular functions = they can do something 
05. high order functions = they can take other functions and do something with it 
06. high order functions, return the functions, hence a chain of functions  
07. high order functions = accept other functions as argument  
08. Array, map, set in javascript. 
09. stack (LIFO), queue (FIFO), linked list, tree 
10. async programming = when things take time 
11. async = your code still runs, while another code is runng in the background	
12. a promise says it will do the task. then it will either return with completion or rejection .then() and .catch() 
13. async/await offers cleaner code 
14. use map instead of object if you're adding key:value pairs cause its faster 
15. maps object, object literals ... whats the difference 
16. today I'm learning about map and set object, feels good man. first time
