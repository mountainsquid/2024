// I need to brush on my while loop 

// let i = 5 
// while(i <= 5) { 
//     console.log(i)
//     i++
// }

// let a = 1 
// while(a <= 5 ) {
//     console.log("counting down A: ", a)
//     a++
// }

// // set b to 3 
// // while b is greater than 0 
// // b-- each time 

// let b = 3
// while(b > 0) {
//     console.log("counting down b: ", b)
//     b--    
// }

// stacy has 5 lifetime sex partners 
// she went to the bar and she's looking to bang
// everytime she has sex with a new guy, the counter goes up by 1 
// first decide stacy's sex count
// then go for the while loop
// while loop always have block code so remember the {}
// after the console log, perform the stacy++ AFTER the console.log is one 

// use case for loop, looping through an array and printing out all the values 
// searching and sorting algos 
// 
let stacy = 5
while (stacy <= 10) {
    console.log("stacy partner countdown: ", stacy)
    stacy++
}

// my brains feel like it's melting and I can't seem to code
// still experiencing brain fog, perhaps this is from drinking coffee? 
// extends keyword establishes the inheritance relationship
// new keyword is to create an instance of a class
// extends keyword is to create a establish a inheritance from 1 class to aother
