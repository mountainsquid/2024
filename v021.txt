Thoughts: 

I'm doing socratic learning, where you just ask questions. Good questions. And learn the things in a deeper level. Finaly I can grasp what closure and hoisting is. Now I just need to learn about it code wise and code it out. 

01. write in pseduo code before you write the real code 
02. event listener = function that waits for an event (DOM) then is triggered and invoked 
03. components of eventlistener = user interaction, DOM event, custom event (what happens when ther is a click)
04. addEventListener() method is the most common 
05. functions can be anon
06. anon functions as callback functions and event listeners 
07. I need to learn what is hoisting and closure in javascript 
08. hoisting = lifting variables and functions at top of the scope during declaration  
09. declaration = reserve memory space for that variable or function 
10. Initialization = assign value to that variable or function
11. Declaration precedes initialization that makes sense 
12. expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and function calls that evaluates to a single result
13. anon function as a once and done type of thing 
14. constructor = Used to create new objects and initialize their properties and methods.
15. anon function = Represent unnamed functions, often used for one-time tasks or assigned to variables/objects.
16. inner and outer functions = nested functions  
15. closure = can access the outer function's variables and functions, and preserves the state and environment of the outer function that the inner function could use
