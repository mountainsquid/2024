Time studied: 30 minutes 

01. Here's a list of concepts I need to learn 
02. require in solidity 
03. modifier in solidity 
04. address data type 
05. reference data types
06. fixed type arrays 
07. dynamic types arrays 
08. calldata vs memory 
09. storage vs memory 
10. struct, array of struct 
11. enum, mapping, mapping with arrays 
12. mapping with struct, nested mapping 
13. global variables, transfer eth
14. mapping in solidity = key value pairs, like dictionary
15. mapping always stored in permanent storage  
16. ues mapping for storing votes, balanaces and such 
17. mapping syntax: mapping(address => string) 
18. like this... : mapping(uint256 => string) public courseCodes;
19. use struct for financial contracts, supply chain, decen marketplace
20. reference data types vs value types in solidity 
21. reference data types points to where the datatype is stored in memory
22. enum = datatype 
22. learn enum syntax and "enum members"
23. in solidity, enum is a user defined datatype and not a data structure 
24.
