01. Visibility Specifiers = for one code to be seen by another code  
02. seems like the levels of Visibility Specifiers is for security purposes 
03. Visibility Specifiers = access control, lessen attack surface 
04. Visibility Specifiers also for modular design, encapsulation and gas optimization 
05. Private vs. Public is fundamental in encapsulation 
06. 4 different types of visibility: public, external, internal and private
07. * only functions can be external in solidity 
08. Remember about external function and public function, we'll get into that later 
09. What is a constructor? It's a special type of function. But what does it do? 
10. Constructor is only run once in the contract creation 
11. Reason why we don't hard code the values but give parameters is because the code becomes more flexible 
12. Yes there is such thing as contract inheritance in solidity, much like class inheritance 
13. interface in solidity. smart contracts interacting with smart contracts interacting with smart contracts 
14. Anyone can interact with the smart contract via their function 
15. interface = a menu of functions in the smart contract that you can interact with 
16. An interface function in Solidity is like a blueprint or prototype for a function that other contracts can interact with.
17. there's abstract contract and regular contract 
18. declare abstract contract by using the keyword "abstract"
19. interface function cannot have constructor 
20. can declare it using interface keyword
