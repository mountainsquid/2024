// a structure is similiar to an object literal in javascript, therefore its not entirely unique 


pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

    // creating my first struct in solidity, feels good man
    // a struct is an object literal in Javascript 
    // but what good is a struct for?
    // store data, property access, ""dynamic structure"" whatever the fuck that means 

    struct blackPinkMembers { 

        // declare the struct because why the fuck not 
        string blackName; 
        uint256 age; 
        string position; 
    }

// mapping is key:pair value, like a dictionary or phone book
// this sounds really similar in javascript ... 
// remember "key value pair" and you should be okay 
// practical example of key value pair? Mapping an 0x address to a name 
// using mapping to find the key:value pair fast!
// => arrow function, think it as "to" something. At least that's what the youtuber said 
// no, => is a mapping operator ... that's interesting 
// array as simply a list of things 
// but it's the index that you get to access the array, feels good man
