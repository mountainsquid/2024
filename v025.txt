// there is an import keyword to import another contract .sol into your current .sol file 
// but why use the import keyword? because it keeps the code organized
// and you can use inheritance to inherit the functionality of the other contract 
// solidity is about contracts interacting with other contracts 
// syntax for inheritance is: contract A is B 
// yup it's that simple 
// bool public hello; 
// invisibility after the datatype, interesting huh
