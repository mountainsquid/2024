===========
  Thoughts:
===========

01. What did I learn overall? Mapping, 2D array, 
02. always declare variable type in solidity first 
03. underscore naming local varibles _hi, _book, _name for easier code reading 

==========
  Notes:
==========

01. array = grouped, sorted data 
02. need to declare the datatype for array... unit[] public uintArray = [1.2.3]
03. string[] public value 
04. there is a memory keyword in solidity 
05. there is a public keyword in solidity 
06. 2 dimensional arrays ... array within an array 
07. Learn more about 2D arrays soon-ish  
08. arrays always start witih 0 index, meaning the first item can call with 0 "index"  
09. maps = objects? map = key and value first name: bugs   
10. mapping is a keyword in solidity 
11. Learn more about constructor function => in solidity 
12. names[1] = "Adam" (this is a mapping)
13. Nested arrays, nested mapping is also possible 
14. Solidity has global variable too, can access that variable anywhere  
15. Think of conditional as a logical gate, that controls the flow of the loop  
16. view is a solidity keyword 
17. Some tutorials are shit at explaining, that's why I'm skipping around videos 
18. class = blueprint, object = a "real" thing :) 
19. new keyword construct the object into real life (or at least, into the machine)
20. parent class, sub class (child)
